    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used for encoding categorical variables into numerical representations. However, they differ in the way they assign numerical values to categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Label Encoding:\n",
    "   Label Encoding assigns a unique numerical label to each category in a categorical variable. The labels are assigned in an arbitrary manner, typically starting from 0 or 1. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Original Categorical Variable:\n",
    "   - Category A\n",
    "   - Category B\n",
    "   - Category C\n",
    "\n",
    "   Label Encoded Variable:\n",
    "   - Category A: 0\n",
    "   - Category B: 1\n",
    "   - Category C: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "   Label Encoding is often suitable when the categorical variable does not have an inherent order or hierarchy. It is commonly used for encoding nominal variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "   Ordinal Encoding assigns numerical values to categories based on their order or ranking. The assigned values reflect the relative position or importance of the categories. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Original Categorical Variable:\n",
    "   - Category A\n",
    "   - Category B\n",
    "   - Category C\n",
    "\n",
    "   Ordinal Encoded Variable:\n",
    "   - Category A: 1\n",
    "   - Category B: 2\n",
    "   - Category C: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "   Ordinal Encoding is useful when the categorical variable has an inherent order or hierarchy. It preserves the ordinal relationship between the categories. This encoding is often used for encoding variables with ordered levels, such as ratings (e.g., low, medium, high) or educational degrees (e.g., primary, secondary, tertiary).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario:\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset containing a \"Size\" feature that represents t-shirt sizes: \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large.\" If the sizes have no inherent order, we can use Label Encoding to assign numerical labels like 0, 1, and 2 to the categories. However, if the sizes have an inherent order (Small < Medium < Large), we should use Ordinal Encoding to assign numerical values based on the order (e.g., 1, 2, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between Label Encoding and Ordinal Encoding depends on the nature of the categorical variable and whether there is an inherent order or hierarchy among the categories. Label Encoding is appropriate for nominal variables without an order, while Ordinal Encoding is suitable for encoding variables with ordered levels."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables by taking into account the relationship between the categories and the target variable. It assigns ordinal numerical values to the categories based on their impact or influence on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean or median target value for each category: For each category in the categorical variable, compute the mean or median value of the target variable. This represents the average target value associated with that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Order the categories based on the mean or median target value: Sort the categories based on their mean or median target values in ascending or descending order. The ordering reflects the impact or influence of each category on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assign ordinal numerical values to the categories: Assign ordinal numerical values to the categories based on their ordered positions. The category with the highest mean or median target value typically receives the highest value, and the category with the lowest mean or median target value receives the lowest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario:\n",
    "Let's consider a machine learning project where you are building a model to predict customer churn in a telecom company. One of the features is the \"Subscription Type,\" which represents the different subscription plans available to customers. we want to encode this categorical variable in a way that captures its influence on the target variable (churn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean or median churn rate for each subscription type.\n",
    "2. Order the subscription types based on their mean or median churn rates.\n",
    "3. Assign ordinal values to the subscription types based on their ordered positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoded Subscription Type:\n",
    "- Plan A: 3\n",
    "- Plan B: 2\n",
    "- Plan C: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, Target Guided Ordinal Encoding assigns numerical values based on the churn rate associated with each subscription type. The encoding reflects the ordering of subscription types in terms of their impact on the target variable (churn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful when there is a meaningful relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable. By considering the target variable, it allows the model to capture the inherent patterns and influence of the categories on the prediction task. It is commonly used when dealing with categorical variables that have a clear ordering or when the target variable shows distinct differences across categories."

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the relationship between two variables. It measures how changes in one variable correspond to changes in another variable. Specifically, covariance indicates whether the variables tend to vary together (covary) or vary in opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relationship between variables: Covariance helps in understanding the relationship between two variables. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to vary in opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Linearity assessment: Covariance is a measure of linear association. It helps determine whether two variables have a linear relationship. If the covariance is close to zero, it suggests a weak or no linear relationship, whereas a nonzero covariance indicates a linear association.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Variable selection: Covariance can assist in selecting relevant variables for analysis. By examining the covariances between variables and the target variable, one can identify variables that have a strong relationship with the outcome of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Portfolio diversification: In finance, covariance is used to assess the diversification of a portfolio. Covariance between different assets helps determine the extent to which their returns move together or in opposite directions. A portfolio with assets that have low or negative covariance provides better diversification and reduces overall risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is calculated using the following formula:\n",
